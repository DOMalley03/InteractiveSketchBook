 <h1>Febuary 23rd</h1>
    <h3>Concept Summary</h3>
        <p>I want to create a cookie-clicker like game where the user clicks a button on screen. When the button is pressed a currency counter goes up. This money from clicking can be used to purchase an upgrade that makes getting more currency easier.</p>

    <h3>Variables and Input</h3>
        <p> let points = 0; Points would be the main currency of the game and clicking the button adds one point. This changes behavior by enticing the user to get a higher score. Buying the upgrades would also make a multiplier go up which can be: let mult = 1
        </p>
    <h3>Base Build</h3>
        <p>let points = 0; 
            let mult = 1; 
            when function mousePressed is used, let points += mult;
            This should add the multiplier on each click so that clicking now gives the multiplier amount


            if upgrade is bought, spend 25 points and mult++. This should add one to the multiplier making clicking easier
            
        </p>
    <h3>Structural Growth</h3>
        <p> Some ideas that I have to grow this project would be possibly adding an 'auto-clicker' upgrade that would automatically give points every second. This could run on a timer variable. Another idea would be to add a decay factor that takes away points every second. It would be nice to also add a possible animation to the click to make it more alive.</p>
