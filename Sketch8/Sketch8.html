    <h2>Pictures of Dave and Buster</h2>
    <p>I used a lot of the code from the demo for this one. I experimented with using my own photos which was tricky since they have different resolutions. Because of that I wanted to try using img.resize but i was unsure how to do it successfully. I instead changed the canvas to display width and height which did the trick. Although it can show the full image, one of th images had such a large resolution that it didnt fully show up. Besides that the length of the array decides the boundaries of the scroll. Besides using left and right you can actually press up to return to the first image or down to go to the last one.
