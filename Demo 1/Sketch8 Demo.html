    <h2>Growing Slowly</h2>
    <p>I tried to do a similar sketch to the one we did in class where clicking on the canvas made the rectangle larger. I added an energy system that forces the user to save up before clicking. If your energy is too low is actually damages the plant by reducing its growth. I was also able to make a cooldown timer that also forces the user to wait in between clicks. Clicking after saving alot of energy shows visible progress, however clicking when the energy is zero is a little buggy with the numbers and prompt since its tied to the cooldown and not the energy. This is supposed to replicate how pushing something too much can hinder its growth. Taking it slow and saving actually shows the most growth in the longrun.
