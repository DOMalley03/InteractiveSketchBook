        <h3>This interaction conveys the feeling of temptation because being 'too anxious' forces the user to wait a little longer. </h3>
        <p>The sketch has a timer that slowly counts down in a set time. If the area is pressed 'or maybe checks movement' it adds time to the timer.</p>
        <h3>waiting, relief, calm, anxiety</h3>

        <h2>Burnout</h2>
        <h3>Over time this interaction imitates the feeling of burnout with the slowing of the sketch</h3>
        <p>The drawing copies the movement of the mouse, but it slowly gets lagged behing. To catch back up to speed, the user needs to move the mouse faster to get more energy. </p>
        <h3>tired, slow, heavy, annoying</h3>

        <h2>Work Hard</h2>
        <h3>Some people get to make alot of money, others have to work hard to make enough</h3>
        <p>The interaction has two counters on both sides. Every mouse click adds the US minimum wage to one of the counters. The other interaction could either be an exponential growth or how much money Amazon makes in a second. The competition is supposed to be impossible for the user to beat.</p>
        <h3>Annoying, sad, waiting</h3>

        <h2>Dont Press</h2>
        <img src="img/DontPressSketch.jpg" alt="Sketch of four interaction stages">
        <p>The core rule of this system is to have the user wait. It is supposed to be annoying watching the timer go down, possibly making the user want to press it. Pressing the button doubles the current time. I wanted to also add a feature for when the timer hits zero and when the timer hits a maximum. This was different from my original design, but i think it makes sense that the timer ends with a reward? I think this design tries to control the users actions by punishing what seems like the correct response(pressing)</p>
