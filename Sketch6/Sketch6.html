    <h2>If My Apple Watch Is Charged</h2>
    <p>This sketch was based on the if___, then___ exercise we did in class. My example was if my apple watch is charged I will take it, otherwise I will leave it on the charger for the day. I tried to simulate the battery level with clicks and the accumulation of green. I changed the steps to 10 so its like the steps of a battery. I experimented with using nested if else statements to get a response at 50% as well when fully charged.</p>
