    <h2>Blueberry</h2>
    <p>I didnt really change any of the code for the demo on this one. I kept the pictures of blueberry and tried to focus on adding a timer. I was having trouble with it because I was changing images every 5 seconds no matter if input was used or not. I had to look up how to fix it and I was using the millis function. The images are centered in this version as well as having an image counter at the top. The auto change also tells the viewer that there are multiple photos to browse through.
