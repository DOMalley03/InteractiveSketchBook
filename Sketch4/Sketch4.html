    <h2>Frozen</h2>
    <p>This sketch was based on the verb freeze. I wanted to play around with the clicking exerciese we did in class. I experiemented with changing the direction the canvas would fill and also added shapes when it was completed. This nested for loop was given as an example in the book and it was fun implementing it into the code.</p>
