    <h3> This sketch was based on the adjective 'Anxious' and moves based on the users mouse. Although it moves left and right the two lines constrain the circle from going further. I used constrain x to only allow the circle to move side to side. I played around with getting different background colors and also changing the shape. Getting a square in the same position as the circle was hard for me so I removed the square. I also tried getting the text under the sketch using footer but it still appears above</h3>
