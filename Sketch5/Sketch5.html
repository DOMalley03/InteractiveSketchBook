    <h2>Frozen 2 (Burning)</h2>
    <p>This sketch was based on the verb freeze, but I switched the color to be 'burning' instead. I changed the if statement to have a message when steps is equal to maxsteps. I also added an else statement that displays a different message while max steps is not reached. I tried to play around with using the mouseReleased function but I wasn't able to make it change color when mouse was released.</p>
