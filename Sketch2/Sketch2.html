    <h3> This sketch was based on the adjective 'Hungry' and uses accumulation of of the mouse. I had the idea of the mouse eating away at the canvas to show the background of the webpage. I had the background load once while the path of the circle was followed with white. This gives the illusion that the green 'leaf' background is being eaten up. I changed the diameter of the circle to see what i liked best</h3>
