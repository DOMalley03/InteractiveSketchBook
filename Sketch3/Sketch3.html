    <h3> This sketch was based on 'Early' and utilizes direct manipulation of the mouse. I was playing around using mouseX vs mouseY for the fill option and tried a few ways to give it color on it as well. I wasn't sure how to do it which is why its black and white. I also added an ellipse for the ground, but i noticed the fill also effects that too.</h3>
